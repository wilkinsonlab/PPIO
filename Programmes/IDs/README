ABOUT
=====

It generates incremental alphanumeric URIs for new OWL entities in a given OWL ontology.

Execute SH to use it. Best way is to start with an empty ontology.


TODO
====

- Ignore imports.
- Ignore no compliant ids.
- Process URIs with slash before fragment.
- Configure alpha/number separator.
- Add more JUnit tests.
- SADI service.
- Sync with ontology in order to avoid loading the whole ontology (e.g. Protege 4 plugin).
